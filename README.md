# spatialMNL

A Bayesian estimation approach for a spatial autoregressive multinomial logit specification. Relies on recent advances in Bayesian computing, making use of Polya-Gamma sampling for Bayesian MCMC algorithms.

For a detailed description of the algorithm, see https://doi.org/10.1080/17421772.2021.1933579
